        Hi! My name is Adrian, I am 19 years old (still for
        <span id="wiek" class="bold text-blue-300"></span>) and I come from
        Poland, more specifically a small town in Greater Poland.

      <div class="mt-3">
        I was infected with "computer science" by nature teacher in primary
        school, Linux's (btw I use Arch Linux ... not funny memes in the form,
        I'm getting better and better ...) I've been using for
        <span id="linux" class="bold text-blue-300"></span> and I've been
        learning webdev for
        <span id="web-dev" class="bold text-blue-300"></span>.
      </div>

      <div class="mt-3">
        In my free time I read (mainly fantasy and crime stories, although
        recently I became interested in "fiction"), I watch (mainly YT and
        series, less movies), sometimes I also play (the masterpieces that I
        recommend are in the
        <a class="linki bold" href="/en/Favorites"
          ><i class="fas fa-link"></i> Favorites</a
        >
        tab). Every day I use ThinkPad T450 (more info in the
        <a class="linki bold" href="/en/setup"
          ><i class="fas fa-link"></i> Setup</a
        >
        tab).

      <div class="mt-3">
        At this point I would like to greet you. Yes, you. You are probably the
        only one who will finish reading this. I really appreciate that! If you
        want to continue checking my scraps, please see the rest of the page.
        Thanks again! ;P
